              <![CDATA[<p>Google has added AI features to its regular Workspace accounts for business while slightly raising the baseline prices of Workspace plans.</p>
<p>Previously, AI tools in the Gemini Business plan were a $20 per seat add-on to existing Workspace accounts, which had a base cost of $12 per seat without. Now, the AI tools are included for all Workspace users, but the per-seat base price is increasing from $12 to $14.</p>
<p>That means that those who were already paying extra for Gemini are going to pay less than half of what they were—effectively $14 per seat instead of $32. But those who never used or wanted Gemini or any other newer features under the AI umbrella from Workspace are going to pay a little bit more than before.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/google-increases-workspace-plan-base-prices-while-adding-gemini-features/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The battery system on an electric car can either charge—from regenerative braking or an external power supply—or discharge—powering the EV's motor(s) or supplying that power via so-called vehicle-to-load. As a rule, it can't do both at once, but General Motors has some thoughts about that. The patent analysis site <a href="https://carmoses.com/gm-wants-evs-to-charge-and-supply-power-at-the-same-time/">CarMoses</a> spotted a recent GM <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadBasicPdf/20240424943?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiI0ZTM5ZjBhZi02ODMxLTQ0YTEtYWU2MS0xNzY2MDIzZTEwMDUiLCJ2ZXIiOiI1NjRhNWFiOC0zNWQwLTQ3OTgtYjEyMy00ZWUzODE3OGQwNzIiLCJleHAiOjB9">patent application</a> for a system that is capable of charging and discharging simultaneously.</p>
<p>The patent describes a "charging system" with a pair of charging ports. One is for drawing power from an external source, just like every other EV. The second charge port is connected to a bi-directional charger, and the battery management system is able to charge the battery pack from the first port while also supplying power from the second port.</p>
<p>That second port could be used to charge another battery, including the battery of another EV, and the patent includes an illustration of three EVs daisy-chained to each other.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/gm-patents-ev-that-can-charge-and-power-stuff-simultaneously/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/01/16/copilot-is-now-included-in-microsoft-365-personal-and-family/">has two announcements</a> for subscribers to its Microsoft 365 Personal and Family plans today. First, you're getting the Copilot-powered AI features that Microsoft has been rolling out to businesses and Copilot Pro subscribers, like summarizing or generating text in Word, drafting slideshows in PowerPoint based on a handful of criteria, or analyzing data in Excel. Second, you'll be paying more for the privilege of using those features, to the tune of an extra $3 a month or $30 a year.</p>
<p>This raises the price of a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/buy/compare-all-microsoft-365-products?culture=en-us&amp;country=us#M365Personalmonthly">Microsoft 365 Personal subscription</a> from $6.99 a month or $69.99 a year to $9.99 and $99.99; a family subscription goes from $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year to $12.99 a month or $129.99 a year. For current subscribers, these prices go into effect the next time your plan renews.</p>
<p>Current subscribers are also being given an escape hatch "for a limited time." "<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/switching-to-microsoft-365-personal-and-family-classic-plans-58342e83-38e7-4cda-b63b-88604a8fb7ef">Classic</a>" Personal and Family plans at the old prices with no Copilot features included will still be offered, but you'll need to go to the "<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/services/">services &amp; subscriptions</a>" page of your Microsoft account and attempt to cancel your existing subscription to be offered the discounted pricing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/home-microsoft-365-plans-use-copilot-ai-features-as-pretext-for-a-price-hike/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX plans to launch the seventh full-scale test flight of its massive Super Heavy booster and Starship rocket Thursday afternoon. It's the first of what might be a dozen or more demonstration flights this year as SpaceX tries new things with the most powerful rocket ever built.</p>
<p>There are many things on SpaceX's Starship to-do list in 2025. They include debuting an upgraded, larger Starship, known as Version 2 or Block 2, on the test flight preparing to launch Thursday. The one-hour launch window opens at 5 pm EST (4 pm CST; 22:00 UTC) at SpaceX's launch base in South Texas. You can watch SpaceX's live webcast of the flight <a href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/mission/?missionId=starship-flight-7">here</a>.</p>
<p>SpaceX will again attempt to catch the rocket's Super Heavy booster<span class="s1">—more than 20 stories tall and wider than a jumbo jet</span><span class="s1">—back at the launch pad using mechanical arms, or "chopsticks," mounted to the launch tower. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/a-taller-heavier-smarter-version-of-spacexs-starship-is-almost-ready-to-fly/">Read more</a> about the Starship Block 2 upgrades in our story from last week.</span></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/heres-what-nasa-would-like-to-see-spacex-accomplish-with-starship-this-year/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Are superheroes and supervillains the product of their childhood experiences? Not if they belong to the Marvel Cinematic Extended Universe or DC Universe, according to a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0315268">new paper</a> published in the journal PLoS ONE. Canadian researchers watched many hours of those movies and looked at which characters suffered considerable childhood trauma. They concluded that those traumatic experiences were not significant factors in whether those characters turned out to be heroes or villains.</p>
<p>Prior studies have looked at the portrayal of <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/english-language-notes/article-abstract/46/2/175/135873/Amazing-Fantasies-Trauma-Affect-and-Superheroes">trauma in superheroes</a>, most notably the murder of Batman's parents and Spider-Man's uncle, as well as the destruction of Superman's home planet, Krypton. There has also been research on children <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2083410/">sustaining injuries</a> while pretending to be superheroes, as well as on the potential for superhero themes to help children <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-06749-002">overcome trauma</a> and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01609513.2020.1826387#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%9Csuperhero%E2%80%9D%20theme%20and%20play,social%20skills">build self-esteem</a>.</p>
<p>According to co-author Jennifer Jackson of the University of Calgary in Canada, two nursing students (since graduated) came up with the idea during a lab meeting to look at adverse childhood experiences and superheroes. It might seem a bit frivolous as a topic, but Jackson pointed out that Marvel and DC films reach audiences of hundreds of millions of people worldwide. "We also know that things we see in films and other media affects life in the real world," she said. "This influence could be used as a positive factor when supporting children's mental health and wellbeing. There may be shame or fear associated with some of the ACEs, and superheroes may be an effective ice breaker when broaching some difficult topics."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/what-marvel-and-dc-heroes-can-teach-us-about-resilience/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Just a few days after more than 700 million new users flooded RedNote—which Time <a href="https://time.com/7207351/tiktok-refugees-us-red-note/">noted</a> is "the most apolitical social platform in China"—rumors began swirling that RedNote may soon start segregating American users and other foreign IPs from the app's Chinese users.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1i2jo3h/predictable/">"TikTokCringe" subreddit,</a> a video from a RedNote user with red eyes, presumably swollen from tears, suggested that Americans had possibly ruined the app for Chinese Americans who rely on RedNote to stay current on Chinese news and culture.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">"RedNote or Xiaohongshu released an update in the greater China region with the function to separate out foreign IPs, and there are now talks of moving all foreign IPs to a separate server and having a different IP for those who are in the greater China area," the Reddit poster said. "I know through VPNs and other ways, people are still able to access the app, but essentially this is gonna kill the app for Chinese Americans who actually use the app to connect with Chinese content, Chinese language, Chinese culture."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/rednote-may-wall-off-tiktok-refugees-to-prevent-us-influence-on-chinese-users/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>AT&amp;T has stopped offering its 5G home Internet service in New York instead of complying with a new state law that requires ISPs to offer $15 or $20 plans to people with low incomes.</p>
<p>The decision was <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/att-is-stopping-its-5g-internet-air-service-in-ny-because-of-new-broadband-law/">reported yesterday by CNET</a> and confirmed by AT&amp;T in a statement provided to Ars today. "While we are committed to providing reliable and affordable Internet service to customers across the country, New York's broadband law imposes harmful rate regulations that make it uneconomical for AT&amp;T to invest in and expand our broadband infrastructure in the state," AT&amp;T said. "As a result, effective January 15, 2025, we will no longer be able to offer AT&amp;T Internet Air, our fixed-wireless Internet service, to New York customers."</p>
<p>New York <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/new-york-starts-enforcing-15-broadband-law-that-isps-tried-to-kill/">started enforcing</a> its Affordable Broadband Act yesterday after a legal battle of nearly four years. Broadband lobby groups convinced a federal judge to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/ny-cant-force-isps-to-offer-15-low-income-broadband-plans-judge-rules/">block the law</a> in 2021, but a US appeals court <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/court-upholds-new-york-law-that-says-isps-must-offer-15-broadband/">reversed the ruling</a> in April 2024, and the Supreme Court <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/big-loss-for-isps-as-supreme-court-wont-hear-challenge-to-15-broadband-law/">decided not to hear</a> the case last month.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/att-complies-with-law-requiring-cheap-internet-by-ending-a-service-in-ny/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The mission began with a middle-of-the-night launch from Kennedy at 1:11 am EST (06:11 UTC) Wednesday.

              <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/review-intel-arc-b580-is-a-compelling-if-incredibly-tardy-250-midrange-gpu/">Intel's Arc B580 graphics cards</a> have been its best-reviewed to date, maintaining the aggressive pricing of the old A-series Arc cards with fewer driver bugs, fewer weird performance outliers, and fewer caveats all around.</p>
<p>And this appears to be translating to retail success—the B580 is sold out across the board and difficult to find at its $249 MSRP. It's hard to tell if this is because demand has been good or supply was low (Intel says it has been restocking "weekly," for what that's worth). But regardless, there's clearly been some pent-up demand for an inexpensive-but-competent entry-level graphics card with decent ray-tracing performance and power efficiency and more than 8GB of RAM.</p>
<p>The Arc B570 is a less-powerful, less-interesting card than the B580, with fewer of Intel's Xe-cores, less memory bandwidth, and 10GB of RAM instead of 12GB. But it offers performance very similar to the RTX 4060 for $80 less—at least, if Intel and its partners can keep it in stock at that price—which makes it a dramatically more interesting budget option than $200-ish cards like the GeForce RTX 3050 or Radeon RX 6600.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/intel-arc-b570-review-at-219-the-cheapest-good-graphics-card/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Making the seventh Civilization game is a tall order. With six prior entries, each with a different flavor, it's challenging to create a unique identity to get people to buy it while ensuring it’s familiar enough that it doesn’t drive longtime fans away.</p>
<p>This week, I spent 15 hours playing <em>Civilization VII</em>—which is slated for release next month—through two of its three ages: Antiquity and Exploration. That’s enough time to know that this is the most radical overhaul yet in a single new release without any expansions.</p>
<p>Regardless, my initial impressions are that this is also a return to form for the series. Like many others, I had gripes about <em>Civilization VI</em>. To be clear, <em>VII</em> isn’t a reset to pre-<em>VI</em> times; some concepts introduced in <em>VI</em> (like the hex-based city district system) are revisited and refined here.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/civilization-vii-preview-a-new-age-for-a-storied-franchise/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The short trailer shows off the Switch 2's larger tablet and screen, and a slightly more rounded edge on the top and bottom. The new system also sports an additional USB-C port on the top (next to a headphone jack) and a wider, U-shaped kickstand along the backside that can support the system at a number of wider angles.</p>
<p>The trailer also shows off black Joy-Cons that are significantly larger than those on the original Switch, with colored accents behind the joystick itself. An extended, colored Joy-Con "rail" on the inner edge features wider shoulder buttons and a new connector in the center. Rather than sliding in vertically, like the plastic rail on the Switch Joy-Cons, the controllers on the Switch 2 snap in horizontally with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/report-switch-2-joy-cons-will-attach-via-magnets/">what appears to be a magnetic connection</a>, and disconnects with the aid of a horizontal lever to the side of the shoulder buttons.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/its-official-take-a-first-look-at-the-switch-2/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For the past seven months—and likely longer—an industry-wide standard that protects Windows devices from firmware infections could be bypassed using a simple technique. On Tuesday, Microsoft finally patched the vulnerability. The status of Linux systems is still unclear.</p>
<p>Tracked as CVE-2024-7344, the vulnerability made it possible for attackers who had already gained privileged access to a device to run malicious firmware during bootup. These types of attacks can be particularly pernicious because infections hide inside the firmware that runs at an early stage, before even Windows or Linux has loaded. This strategic position allows the malware to evade defenses installed by the OS and gives it the ability to survive even after hard drives have been reformatted. From then on, the resulting "bootkit" controls the operating system start.</p>
<p>In place since 2012, Secure Boot is designed to prevent these types of attacks by creating a chain-of-trust linking each file that gets loaded. Each time a device boots, Secure Boot verifies that each firmware component is digitally signed before it’s allowed to run. It then checks the OS bootloader's digital signature to ensure that it's trusted by the Secure Boot policy and hasn't been tampered with. Secure Boot is built into the UEFI—short for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface—the successor to the BIOS that’s responsible for booting modern Windows and Linux devices.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/microsoft-patches-windows-to-eliminate-secure-boot-bypass-threat/">Read full article</a></p>

"Even at our headquarter site here in Campbell, in Silicon Valley, we've had our site vandalized twice," said Rick Wilmer, CEO of ChargePoint. His customers are starting to get fed up with the problem, too, and so Wilmer has had the company hard at work on a solution: an uncuttable cable, which should be ready to deploy by early summer.</p>
<p>"I literally got so frustrated ... I was at home in my own workshop, building prototypes and taking all my nastiest tools to them, to try and cut them, to see what we could come up with," Wilmer told me. It's a simple idea, involving hardened steel and "some other polymer materials that are just really hard to cut through," Wilmer said.</p>
<p>As well as making cables for its own chargers, ChargePoint plans to license its invention to others in the industry. "So we've collaborated with a few [cable vendors] to build these cables... and we can refer anyone that's interested to those vendors and give [them] permission to build cables with this technology for someone other than us," Wilmer said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/chargepoint-develops-uncuttable-charging-cables-to-stop-thieves/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was Wikipedia Day, celebrating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Wikipedia#cite_note-2">the first edit made to the online encyclopedia</a> on January 15, 2001. It's a tricky kind of celebration because, for many of us, every day is a Wikipedia Day. Scanning a new Wikipedia tab can feel like turning on a faucet, using a resource that has seemingly always been there and dispensed evenly, almost magically, from the Internet pipes.</p>
<p>But that's not where Wikipedia comes from. It comes from editors, who are volunteers that add missing topics, update pages when new things happen, and settle debates ranging from grammar ticks to deep philosophy. Author Stephen Harrison has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Harrison">written about these people</a> for Slate, WIRED, The Guardian, and The New York Times. Now, he's exploring the distinctive lives, interests, and conflicts of this tribe in a fiction tome, <em><a href="https://www.stephenharrison.com/">The Editors</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>The Editors</em> follows Morgan Wentworth, a recently laid-off journalist who scopes out a freelance story at a global conference for the book's Wiki stand-in, Infopendium. Wentworth sees the breadth of ages, personalities, and motivations among the editors and comes to appreciate their dedication. Then, a hacker breaks in, posts a cryptic message, and triggers Wentworth's expanding investigation into a global struggle over truth and information.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/the-editors-weaves-wikipedias-volunteers-into-a-global-suspense-tale/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Lots of startups use Google's productivity suite, known as Workspace, to handle email, documents, and other back-office matters. Relatedly, lots of business-minded webapps use Google's OAuth, i.e. "Sign in with Google." It's a low-friction feedback loop—up until the startup fails, the domain goes up for sale, and somebody forgot to close down all the Google stuff.</p>
<p>Dylan Ayrey, of Truffle Security Co., <a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/millions-at-risk-due-to-google-s-oauth-flaw">suggests in a report</a> that this problem is more serious than anyone, especially Google, is acknowledging. Many startups make the critical mistake of not properly closing their accounts—on both Google and other web-based apps—before letting their domains expire.</p>
<p>Given the number of people working for tech startups (6 million), the failure rate of said startups (90 percent), their usage of Google Workspaces (50 percent, all by Ayrey's numbers), and the speed at which startups tend to fall apart, there are a lot of Google-auth-connected domains up for sale at any time. That would not be an inherent problem, except that, as Ayrey shows, buying a domain with a still-active Google account can let you re-activate the Google accounts for former employees.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/startup-necromancy-dead-google-apps-domains-can-be-compromised-by-new-owners/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard arguments that could determine if a Texas age-gating law preventing kids from accessing pornography online is overly burdensome for adults. A ruling against Texas could put an end to allegedly invasive age-verification laws in nearly 20 states.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A decision isn't expected until summer 2025, so it's too soon to say which way the court is leaning.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/supreme-court-will-review-texas-law-requiring-age-verification-on-porn-sites/">question before the court</a> is whether the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/texas-can-require-age-verification-on-porn-sites-5th-circuit-judges-rule/">5th Circuit was right</a> to stay a preliminary injunction that had previously been blocking Texas from enforcing the law or whether that decision should be reversed and remanded based on the level of constitutional scrutiny that the 5th Circuit applied.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/texas-age-verification-law-masks-broader-anti-porn-agenda-lawyer-warns-scotus/">Read full article</a></p>

      Charlie Cox's Matt Murdock returns in Marvel's new series <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p><em>Daredevil</em> is among <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/11/wilson-fisk-is-back-and-better-than-ever-in-season-3-of-daredevil/">my favorite stories</a> in the Netflix <em>Defenders</em> universe—along with <em>Jessica Jones—</em>in large part because Wilson Fisk (aka Kingpin, played to perfection by Vincent D'Onofrio), was such an incredibly complex and even occasionally sympathetic villain in the first and second seasons. I'm far from alone in this assessment, which explains why it was such a blow to fans when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/11/the-bloodbath-continues-netflix-cancels-daredevil-after-three-seasons/">Netflix canceled</a> the critically acclaimed <em>Daredevil</em> (and the rest of its <em>Defenders</em> series) in 2018, despite the showrunners' plans for a fourth season.</p>
<p>Charlie Cox's titular vigilante hero has since made a couple of cameos in other Marvel projects, most notably as a one-night stand for Tatiana Maslany's <em>She-Hulk</em> in 2022. That kept hope alive that <em>Daredevil</em> might be revived and/or re-imagined. The hope has paid off because Marvel Studios just released a trailer for the new nine-episode series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil:_Born_Again"><em>Daredevil: Born Again</em></a>. And the studio has already confirmed a second season as part of the MCU's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe:_Phase_Five">Phase Five</a>.</p>
<p>D'Onofrio's Fisk (who also appeared in the limited series <em>Echo</em> and <em>Hawkeye</em>) is back, of course. Per the official premise: "Murdock, a blind lawyer with heightened abilities, is fighting for justice through his bustling law firm, while former mob boss Wilson Fisk pursues his own political endeavors in New York. When their past identities begin to emerge, both men find themselves on an inevitable collision course."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/01/the-trailer-for-daredevil-born-again-is-here/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A Washington-based launch company <a href="https://www.stokespace.com/stoke-space-announces-260-million-in-new-investment/">announced Wednesday</a> that it has raised $260 million in Series C funding, a significant capital raise at a time when it has become more difficult for some space companies to attract funding.</p>
<p>"The market is tough, but I think what we’re doing is poised to go straight to the end state of the industry, and I think investors recognize that," said Andy Lapsa, Stoke Space's co-founder and chief executive officer, in an interview with Ars after the announcement.</p>
<p>By "end state of the industry," Lapsa means that Stoke is developing a fully reusable medium-lift rocket named Nova. The vehicle's first stage will land vertically, similarly to a Falcon 9 rocket, and the second stage, which has a novel metallic heat shield and engine design, will also land back on Earth.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/stoke-space-raises-a-ton-of-money-as-it-moves-closer-to-debut-launch/">Read full article</a></p>
